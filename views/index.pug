  // probably not reproduced exactly but pretty fucking close. nothing better to do at this point.
  // plan for a grid container with 3 items
  // one is a clear icon.
  // another is an up down icon which transitions
  // another is a number that is at maximum the number of selected columns for sort
  // all these appearing to the right of the text inline and sized appropriately
  // user clicks the up or down arrow and it sorts ascending or descending
  // icon turns pure white when selected
  // icon is black bordered in white when inactive
  // number is white on a black background and disappears, AGAIN when not selected.
  // each click results in javascript event modifying a global variable in indexscripts.js which contains
  // sort filters.
  // plan also for a drilldown view as well with subgrids reexploring css3 grid functionality sitting
  // in the same fucking place.
  // oh and if 'I' appreciates anything its usually bad news for "U"/Loki/John R Sohn
  // as usual.
